<h1>The Seven Wonders Of The World - NextJs & TypeScript</h1>

This project offers an interactive map application for those who want to explore the world's seven wonders. Each wonder's location and mini photos are displayed on the integrated map using the Leaflet library. When users click on these photos, a photo preview is shown with photographer information and location data. The icon above the photos directs them to the detail page, where detailed information, descriptions of the wonder, and a more detailed location map are displayed. Responsive design with TailwindCSS provides a compatible user experience on all devices.

<h2>Technical Features:</h2>

Leaflet.js: Interactive map showing the world map and locations of the wonders. The correct locations with latitude and longitude information of each wonder are located on the map.

Next.js: The powerful features of Next.js were used to improve the front end of the application, providing page redirects and performance optimization. Static Site Generation (SSG) was used to load static information about the wonders at the top of the page.

React: React, used for dynamic data management, manages interactive elements on the map with user interaction (e.g., photo clicks and redirection to the detail page). With React's state management features, awesome information is dynamically updated with each click.

TailwindCSS: TailwindCSS is a minimalist, flexible, and fast CSS framework that facilitates the application's responsive design and offers a compatible appearance on every device. It is also used for inclusive grid structures and models on the map.

Map Interaction: When users click on any wonder on the map, the photo, location information, and description text of that wonder are displayed. More information about the wonder and a detailed map are provided on the detail page.

High Performance: Next.js's server-side rendering (SSR) features ensure that pages load quickly and are SEO-compatible. In addition, unnecessary re-rendering operations are minimized, and the application's performance is optimized.
